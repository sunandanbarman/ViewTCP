# ViewTCP
Initial revision
This is my first project in c#.net technology, which I wanted to give a try from a long time, but never got around to it.
But here it is now, my first TCP-UDP endpoint connections viewer, lovingly called "ViewTCP" ( how very original !)
Industry standard tool for this is SysInternals' TcpView, which is something which I tried to replicate in my own humble way.
So the features are not a ripoff, rather an attempt to learn by doing. And trust me, I learned a lot.

Version 1.0.0.0 ( 21 Dec 15 ):

Initial revision . First commit.
